 * <ul style="color:blue">
 * <li>if that primitive types use as a local variables you cannot see that
 * variables value because of you gets a compile error</li>
 * <li>hexadecimals declares as '0x1a' = 26 and binaries '0b10101'</li> <liThe
 * Java programming language also supports a few special escape sequences for
 * char and String literals: \b (backspace), \t (tab), \n (line feed), \f (form
 * feed), \r (carriage return), \" (double quote), \' (single quote), and \\
 * (backslash).</li>
 * <li>There's also a special null literal that can be used as a value for any
 * reference type. null may be assigned to any variable, except variables of
 * primitive types. There's little you can do with a null value beyond testing
 * for its presence. Therefore, null is often used in programs as a marker to
 * indicate that some object is unavailable</li>
 * <li>Finally, there's also a special kind of literal called a class literal,
 * formed by taking a type name and appending ".class"; for example,
 * String.class. This refers to the object (of type Class) that represents the
 * type itself.</li>
 * <li>In Java SE 7 and later, any number of underscore characters (_) can
 * appear anywhere between digits in a numerical literal. This feature enables
 * you, for example. to separate groups of digits in numeric literals, which can
 * improve the readability of your code.</li>
