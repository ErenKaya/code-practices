 * * Primitive Data Types
 * </p>
 * <li>short</li>
 * <p>
 * It has a minimum value of -32,768 and a maximum value of 32,767 (inclusive).
 * </p>
 * <li>int</li>
 * <p>
 * In Java SE 8 and later, you can use the int data type to represent an
 * unsigned 32-bit integer,
 * </p>
 * <li>long</li>
 * <p>
 * Java SE 8 and later, you can use the long data type to represent an unsigned
 * 64-bit long,
 * </p>
 * <li>float</li>
 * <p>
 * The float data type is a single-precision 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point
 * </p>
 * <li>double</li>
 * <p>
 * The double data type is a double-precision 64-bit IEEE 754 floating point.
 * </p>
 * <li>boolean</li>
 * <p>
 * The boolean data type has only two possible values: true and false.
 * </p>
 * <li>char</li>
 * <p>
 * The char data type is a single 16-bit Unicode character. It has a minimum
 * value of '\u0000' (or 0) and a maximum value of '\uffff' (or 65,535
 * inclusive).
 * </p>
 * <ul>
 * <h3>String</h3>
 * <p>
 * In addition to the eight primitive data types listed above, the Java
 * programming language also provides special support for character strings via
 * the java.lang.String class. Enclosing your character string within double
 * quotes will automatically create a new String object; for example, String s =
 * "this is a string";. String objects are immutable, which means that once
 * created, their values cannot be changed. The String class is not technically
 * a primitive data type, but considering the special support given to it by the
 * language, you'll probably tend to think of it as such.
